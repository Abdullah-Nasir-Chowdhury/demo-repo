All commands:

cd [directory]
cd .. : go to previous directory
ls : shows all files
ls -Force : shows hidden files
git status : shows modified and untracked files 
git add. : tell git to track all the files listed in status (in both untracked and modified section). Once done, all files are ready to be committed.
git add [file_name] : only tracks the individual folder you tell it to track
git commit -m "Added index.html" -m "some description": -m means message, ideally the message should have the what and why behind the commit you are making, second -m is a message added to the description box.

but we have still only saved our code locally and it isn't live on github. Make it live using git push

git push : push this live to a remote repository where my project is hosted.


cat testkey : show your ssh key
cat testkey.pub : show your ssh key
type testkey.pub | clip : to copy your SSH Key from the terminal
